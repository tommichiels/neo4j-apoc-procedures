== Format

We send all nodes and relationships of the passed in data convert into individual Gephi-Streaming JSON fragements, separated by `\r\n`.

{"an":{"345":{"TYPE":"Movie","label":"Forrest Gump",                               x:234,y:122,r:0.2,g:0.2,b:0.7}}}\r\n

== Specifics Details

Gephi doesn't render the graph data unless you also provide x,y coordinates in the payload, so we just send random ones within a 1000x1000 grid.

We also generate colors per label combination and relationship-type, both of which are also transferred as `TYPE` property.

// TODO also generate clustering information.
