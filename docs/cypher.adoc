= Running Cypher fragments

We can use Cypher as safe, graph-aware, partially compiled scripting language within APOC.

include::../readme.adoc[tags=cypher,labeloffset=-1]

== Example: Fast Node-Counts by Label

Counts by label are quickly provided by the counts-store, but only if they are the the single thing in the query, like

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person) RETURN count(*);
----

It also works to combine several with `UNION ALL`, but not via `WITH`

.Doesn't work
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person) WITH count(*) as people
MATCH (:Movie) RETURN people, count(*) as movies;
----

.Works
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person) RETURN count(*)
UNION ALL
MATCH (:Movie) RETURN count(*);
----


But with `apoc.cypher.run` we can construct the statement and run each of them individually, so it completes in a few ms.

[source,cypher]
----
call db.labels() yield label
call apoc.cypher.run("match (:`"+label+"`) return count(*) as count", null) yield value
return label, value.count as count
----
