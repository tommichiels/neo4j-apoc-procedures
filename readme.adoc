== "APOC" Name history

http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Apoc[Apoc] was the technician and driver on board of the Nebuchadnezzar in the Matrix movie. He was killed by Cypher.

*APOC* was also the first bundled http://neo4j.com/blog/convenient-package-neo4j-apoc-0-1-released/[A Package Of Components] for Neo4j in 2009.

*APOC* also stands for "Awesome Procedures On Cypher"

== Download latest release (for the regular user)

Go to http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/latest
to find the latest release and download the binary jar to place into your $NEO4J_HOME/plugins folder.

== Build & install the current development branch from source

[source,shell]
----
git clone http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures
./gradlew shadow
cp build/libs/apoc-<version>-SNAPSHOT-all.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins/
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
----

// If you want to run embedded or use neo4j-shell on a disk store, configure your `plugins` directory in `conf/neo4j.conf` with `dbms.plugin.directory=path/to/plugins`.

A full build including running the tests can be run by `./gradlew build`.

== Calling Procedures within Cypher

Procedures can be called stand-alone with `CALL procedure.name();`

But you can also integrate them into your Cypher statements which makes them so much more powerful.

.Load JSON example
[source,cypher]
----
WITH 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/master/src/test/resources/person.json' AS url

CALL apoc.load.json(url) YIELD value as person

MERGE (p:Person {name:person.name})
   ON CREATE SET p.age = person.age, p.children = size(person.children)
----

// end::intro[]

.Cypher for getting count of procedure in a package
[source,cypher]

----

CALL dbms.procedures() YIELD name
RETURN head(split(name,".")) as package, count(*), collect(name) as procedures;

----

// end::procedurecount[]

== Version Compatibility Matrix

Since APOC relies in some places on Neo4j's internal APIs you need to use the right APOC version for your Neo4j installaton.

Any version to be released after 1.1.0 will use a different, consistent versioning scheme: `<neo4j-version>.<apoc>` version. The trailing `<apoc>` part of the version number will be incremented with every apoc release.

[options=headers]
|===
|apoc version | neo4j version
|3.0.4.1 | 3.0.4
|1.1.0 | 3.0.0 - 3.0.3
|1.0.0 | 3.0.0 - 3.0.3
